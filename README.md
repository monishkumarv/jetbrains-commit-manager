2. Search for "Extensions: Additional Extension Galleries"
3. Click "Edit in settings.json"

}
```

5. Reload the window
6. Open Extensions (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+X`), search "JetBrains Commit Manager", and install

### Option B: Install from VSIX (offline/manual)

2. Open VS Code/Cursor IDE
3. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
4. Click the "..." menu â†’ "Install from VSIX..."
5. Select the downloaded `.vsix` file
6. **Don't forget to enable auto-updates** in extension settings

## Usage

### Changelists

- **Create**: Right-click in the sidebar â†’ "Create Changelist"
- **Move files**: Drag & drop files between changelists
- **Delete**: Right-click changelist â†’ "Delete Changelist" (files move to default)
- **Revert**: Right-click changelist â†’ "Revert Changelist"

### Committing and Ammending commits

- **Select files**: Click checkboxes next to files
- **Commit**: Use the status bar button or `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Commit Selected Files". When committing from commands or the status bar, you can choose:
  - `Commit`
  - `Amend Commit`
  - `Commit and Push`
  - `Amend Commit and Push`
- **Amend**: In the webview and commit dialog, there is an "Amend last commit" checkbox. In the compact sidebar UI, rightâ€‘click the Commit button to toggle "Amend" (button label shows "Amend:" when active).
- **Push**: Choosing a "â€¦and Push" option will push the current branch after a successful commit. If the branch has no upstream set, the extension will set upstream to `origin/<branch>` on first push.
- **Stash**: Use the stash button next to commit for temporary storage
