# JetBrains Commit Manager

A VS Code extension that brings JetBrains-like commit workflows (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, etc.) to VS Code: organize changes into changelists, drag & drop files between them, select exactly what to commit, and work efficiently from the status bar or command palette.

## Configuration

### Auto-Stage Files

The extension can automatically stage files when they are changed or created (only if already tracked by Git). Enabled by default; control via:

- **Settings**: Go to VS Code Settings and search for "jetbrains-commit-manager.autoStageFiles"
- **Command**: Use "JetBrains Commit Manager: Toggle Auto-Stage Files" command
- When enabled, tracked-file modifications are auto-staged; untracked files are never auto-staged to avoid adding temporary/build artifacts by accident.

#### Auto-Stage Skip Patterns

Certain files are intentionally skipped from auto-stage (examples): temp files (`*.tmp`, swap files), build artifacts (`*.log`, `*.o`, `*.class`), IDE files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`), `node_modules/`, lockfiles, `.git/`, and environment files like `.env*`.
