# JetBrains Commit Manager

A VS Code extension that replicates the commit management functionality of JetBrains IDEs (like GoLand, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.) with drag-and-drop changelist management and selective file committing.

## Features

### üéØ JetBrains-Style Commit Management

- **Changelist Organization**: Organize your changes into logical groups (changelists)
- **Drag & Drop**: Move files between changelists by dragging and dropping
- **Selective Committing**: Choose which files to commit with checkboxes
- **Visual Status Indicators**: See file status (modified, added, deleted, untracked) with color-coded icons

### üìÅ Changelist Management

- **Default Changelist**: All changes start in the default changelist
- **Custom Changelists**: Create named changelists for different features or tasks
- **File Organization**: Drag files between changelists without using CLI
- **Changelist Deletion**: Delete changelists (files move to default)

### ‚úÖ File Selection & Committing

- **Checkbox Selection**: Click files to select/deselect them for commit
- **Bulk Operations**: Select all or deselect all files
- **Integrated Commit UI**: Commit message input and button in a dedicated commit section
- **Source Control Style UI**: Commit UI similar to VS Code's Source Control tab
- **File Preview**: See which files will be committed before confirming

### üîÑ Real-time Updates

- **File System Watching**: Automatically refresh when files change
- **Git Status Integration**: Real-time Git status updates
- **Live Refresh**: Manual refresh option available
- **Auto-Stage Files**: Automatically stage modified files that are already tracked by Git (untracked files are not auto-staged)

When enabled, any modifications to files that are already tracked by Git will be automatically staged. New untracked files are not auto-staged to prevent accidentally adding temporary or build files to version control.
